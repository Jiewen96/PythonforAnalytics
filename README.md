# Assign-3 - Python 


mix potato

### Installation
python3 setup.py install

### Algorithm 
The base.py contains one function and one class. The function contained simply prints 'Hello World' when called. The salad class consists two functions: read and write. Read transforms the input values into separate files and write function turns these files into a dictionary. 

### Final Output 

Example:
salad_items = ['lettuce', 'tomato']
salad_numbers = [2, 3]

mysalad will return {'lettuce': 2, 'tomato': 3} as the final product 

The whole process(read and write) takes:
The start time is : 10849.978258628
The time difference is : 0.004857693000303698 sec
